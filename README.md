# MangoSeed
A library/command line utility (that can be installed a [.net tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/global-tools)) to import/export data from MongoDb.

The tool is similar to MongoImport/Export, but 
1. can be used as a library, which may be easier to use in test scenarios
2. has options for parallel file processing
3. is written in .net, making it easier to customize for a .net developer to customize how the tool works
